This is level 01 of project-euler!

I made the VecInt class so that it would be easier to work with large numbers!


### Project Euler Progress Update

#### Overview
I've made significant progress on Project Euler, completing levels 1 through 25. However, level 18 remains an ongoing challenge that I plan to revisit. Below is a brief summary of my progress and a checklist of completed levels.
